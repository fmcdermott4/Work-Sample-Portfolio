                Welcome to my page. My name is Frank McDermott and I love my family, coffee and working in that order! I cut my professional teeth working in the oilfield service industry, specializing in hydraulic fracturing. Now I work in the remanufacturing industry, which may be the most sustainable and green industry in America. I am interested in sustainability, Six Sigma methodology and data collection. Please check out my work <a href="#myWork">below</a> Also, the background coffee beans were roasted by me!

<!-- 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
